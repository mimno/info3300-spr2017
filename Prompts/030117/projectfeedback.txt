[Hearst's Questions]
This visualization makes important information visually salient.
This visualization uses visual components appropriately.
This visualization successfully presents multiple relevant facts in a single visual pattern.

[Functionality]
Correct use of relative URL paths.
All elements work correctly without manipulation.
The page loads in a reasonable amount of time.

[Perception]
I know which elements/properties have meaning and which do not.
I immediately know how to interpret visual elements.
I can accurately decode numeric values for variables.
I can compare values of the same variable for different data points.
Scales are selected appropriately for data types.

[Special data points]
Outliers are marked or handled appropriately.
I can identify interesting examples (outliers, typical cases).

[Focus and Depth]
The project says something, it has a clear argument.
I am able to test/confirm the assertions of the project's argument.
I can formulate and test my own argument.

[Data]
I understand the cultural context of the data.
Data was collected ethically.
Data is of manageable complexity: neither trivial nor overwhelming.

[Lasting effect]
I learned something.
The work is original, unexpected, or surprising.
I want to know more about how the creators made the project.

[Specific scales]

Position scales:

The meaning of x and y positions is clear.
Transformations (log, sqrt) are used appropriately and clearly marked.
Datapoints are distinguishable; overplotting is addressed effectively.

Size scales:

The relationship between area and the underlying data value is clear.
Area scales are based at zero.
Area changes proportional to data values.

Color scales:

Categorical color values are easy to distinguish (no more than seven).
Continuous color values enable meaningful comparisons.
Ordinal color values reflect meaningful divisions between levels of a variable.

Bar and Pie charts:

Each segment is clearly distinguishable.
I can make accurate comparisons based on relative positions.

Networks:

I can follow individual paths. Links are not overwhelming.

Maps:

The projection is accurate and informative.
Density of information is balanced with land area: Panama/Qatar vs. Russia/Brazil.
